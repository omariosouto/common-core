# 1.0.5 - 2025-5-8

Just adding tests


# 1.0.4 - 2025-4-21

Just adjusting how we export lodash stuff


# 1.0.3 - 2025-4-21

We need this type to be able to work with values like money on Web (for fast previews) and Back End (To ensure that we are handling thigns properly)


# 1.0.2 - 2025-4-19

Just reexporting lodash types


# 1.0.1 - 2025-4-18

Here I'm just exposing the first version of the library with lodash built-in and sleep function
Remember:
- If you are a library using me, always expose as a `peerDependency`, if you are a final app use as `dependency`.
